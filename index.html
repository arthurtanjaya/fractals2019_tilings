            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this Cornell SPUR project is to study tilings on the Sierpinski gasket and its blow-ups. TODO
        </p>
        <p>
            Let $A$ be a closed subset of SG. Consider translates of $A$ that tile SG. So SG is the union of $A_k$, and the intersection of $A_j$ and $A_k$ is either empty or suitably small. Translate means there is a local isometry $T$ with $A_k = TA$. For what sets $A$ do such translation tilings exist?

            A related question involves the existence of a basis (maybe orthonormal) of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on $A$. The equivalence of these conditions in Euclidean space is called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuglede\%27s_conjecture}{Fuglede's conjecture}, but recently it has been shown to be false in both directions. For example, if $A$ is a $k$-cell then $A$ tiles SG and $A$ has a basis of Dirichlet (or Neumann) eigenfunctions.

            Although Fuglede's conjecture has been shown to be false in both directions, there are many special cases where it is known to be true, and this has led to a lot of interesting research. We would like to explore related problems on SG.

            \begin{question}
            Consider a discrete approximation to $\text{SG}_n$, and let $A \subseteq \text{SG}_n$. When does there exist a set of translations $T$ such that
            \[
            \text{SG}_n = \bigsqcup_{\tau_k \in T}(A + \tau_k)?
            \]
            \end{question}

            \begin{problem}
            Find an algorithm that gives all such tilings by translations.
            \end{problem}

            \begin{question}
            Again given $A \subseteq \text{SG}_n$, does there exist an orthonomal basis of functions $\{\varphi_j\}$ on $\ell^2(A)$ such that each $\varphi_j$ has an extension $\widetilde{\varphi}_j$ on $\text{SG}_n$ satisfying an eigenvalue equation
            $-\Delta_n \widetilde{\varphi}_j = \lambda_{n, j} \widetilde{\varphi}_j$ on $\text{SG}_n$?
            \end{question}

            \begin{problem}
            Find an algorithm that yields all such exponential bases.
            \end{problem}
