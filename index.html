            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this Cornell SPUR project is to study tilings on the Sierpinski gasket and its blow-ups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let $A$ be a closed subset of SG. Consider translates of $A$ that tile SG. So SG is the union of $A_k$, and the intersection of $A_j$ and $A_k$ is either empty or suitably small. Translate means there is a local isometry $T$ with $A_k = TA$. For what sets $A$ do such translation tilings exist?
        </p>
        <p>
            A related question involves the existence of a basis (maybe orthonormal) of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on $A$. The equivalence of these conditions in Euclidean space is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuglede%27s_conjecture">Fuglede's conjecture</a>, but recently it has been shown to be false in both directions. For example, if $A$ is a $k$-cell then $A$ tiles SG and $A$ has a basis of Dirichlet (or Neumann) eigenfunctions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Fuglede's conjecture has been shown to be false in both directions, there are many special cases where it is known to be true, and this has led to a lot of interesting research. We would like to explore related problems on SG.

            <div class="question">
                Consider a discrete approximation to $\text{SG}_n$, and let $A \subseteq \text{SG}_n$. When does there exist a set of translations $T$ such that
                \[
                \text{SG}_n = \bigsqcup_{\tau_k \in T}(A + \tau_k)?

                Again given $A \subseteq \text{SG}_n$, does there exist an orthonomal basis of functions $\{\varphi_j\}$ on $\ell^2(A)$ such that each $\varphi_j$ has an extension $\widetilde{\varphi}_j$ on $\text{SG}_n$ satisfying an eigenvalue equation $-\Delta_n \widetilde{\varphi}_j = \lambda_{n, j} \widetilde{\varphi}_j$ on $\text{SG}_n$?
